  <h2>Godwin Bassey</h2>
  <h2>MOB(Pronounced EM-OBI)</h2>
  <p>I'm Godwin Bassey, a newly-inducted dentist who is interested in getting a Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I am currently single and i'm a huge fan of music particularly Technical Death Metal and Hip-Hop.</p>
  <p>I am interested in sofware development particularly backend web development and AI technology because I'm trying to see ways to merge my medical knowledge with tech to aid diagnosis and treatment planning with well-written algorithms.</p>
  <p>I have been a member of the Chuch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life so finding out the church made a way for us to gain high quality education remotely and virtually no cost made me excited of the prospects and possibilities. I can't wait to see where this leads me and what careers I would be able to bud from here.</p>
