      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to provide accurate information from the point of view of a dentist regarding the two most important and common oral health diseases - dental caries and periodontitis. I plan to debunk myths on the aetiologies and pathogenesis of these diseases in a simplified form and provide ways to prevent them, identify them and when to see your dentist for management.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h4>Dental Diseases and You</h4>
        <p>
          Dental diseases - the most common of which include tooth decay also known as dental caries and periodontitis - can have significant effect on the quality of life of an individual and the society at large. I'm sure you're wondering how dental diseases can influence the society at large. Well, it easy - if you have to miss work because you're getting treated for a dental disease, this means less manpower at work which ultimately leads to a reduction in productivity of the community. This is just one of the numerous ways the burden of dental diseases can impact the community

        <h4>On the bright side!</h4>
        <p>
          Fear not, it's not all bad news because for more than 70 years it has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt that these diseases are largely preventable. The even better news is that you don't need to break your life savings to prevent these diseases. All you need is a minor modifications of your daily life activities including your diet, oral hygiene habits, dental visit behaviour and other lifestyle adjsutments.

      <h3>Tooth decay</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Tooth decay or more accurately called dental caries is a sugar-dependent infectious disease of the dental hard tissues.
          Sugar-dependent in that there needs to be a supply of fermentable sugars ib order for this disease to occur. Infectious in that these sugars need to be fermented by microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli in order for this disease to occur. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The accumulation of acids as a by-product of the metabolism of these sugars (particularly sucrose found in refined sugars) on the surface of your teeth results in the dissolution of the mineral crystals that make up the microscopic structure of your teeth (dental hard tissues). The early process of this disease is largely reversible, however once a cavity or hole forms, it is past the point of no return and if left untreated by a dental professional, it could result in severe complications including DEATH!

        <h4>Myths and facts</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Myth - No pain, No problem</li>
            <li>Fact - Even in the absence of pain, tooth destruction still occurs and by the time pain occurs, a complication most likely has begun occuring and the management becomes a little more complicated</li>
            <li>Myth - Tooth decay is a result of divine retribution to disobedient children</li>
            <li>Fact - Sugars cause tooth decay and naughty and nice children can suffer from the disease. In fact, I'd argue that nice children are more likely to have dental caries because they tend to be rewarded more often with sugary treats than naughty kids. They are also more likely to be allowed to go to bed without brushing as a reward for their good behaviour.</li>
            <li>Myth - Sugar-free sodas can't cause tooth decay</li>
            <li>Fact - This is true to an extent. It's true because these are better than consuming sugary beverages. It is however largely false because these sodas still are very acidic and can still cause or accelerate the dissolution of the minerals that make up your teeth</li>

        <h4>Signs and symptoms</h4>
        <p>
          These are how you can tell if you have dental caries or one of its complications
          <ol>
            <li>Noticable hole in teeth</li>
            <li>Pain which may occur on its own or may be triggered by hot or cold foods, sour or sweet foods or biting</li>
            <li>Swelling within or around the mouth</li>
            <li>Breaking down of teeth</li>
            <li>Inexplicable tooth discoloration</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Prevention</h4>
        <p>
          Tooth decay or dental caries is a largely preventable disease and even after the formation of a hole, it can be prevented from getting worse by appropriate management by a dental professional.
          <ol>
            <li>Improved oral hygiene practices which includes brushing at least twice a day</li>
            <li>Reduced intake of refined sugars</li>
            <li>Replacement of sugary beverages with fruit sugars</li>
            <li>Use of fluoridated toothpaste</li>
            <li>Regular dental visits</li>
            <li>Fissure sealing - this is done by the dental professional and involves sealing of the crevices of your back teeth with a flowable material that reduces the accumulation of sugars and reservior of bacteria.</li>

      <h3>Periodontitis</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The periodontium in the human mouth consits of four primary structures. These incldue the:
          <ul>
            <li>The gums (gingiva) - the pink soft covering of the tooth-bearing bone</li>
            <li>The cementum - bone-like covering of the root of your teeth</li>
            <li>The periodontal ligament - tissue fibers and cells that anchor the tooth root to the bone</li>
            <li>The alveolar bone - the tooth-bearing bone of the upper and lower jaws</li>
          </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
          Periodontitis is simply the inflammation of these tissues. It more specifically and accurately refers to the inflammation of said tissue along with the reduction of the height of the supporting bone with the formation of a pocket. So, simply put, periodontits is the inflammation of periodontal tissues. It is caused by the accumulation of plaque and its extent and progession can vary from person to person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Periodontitis like a lot of human diseases is preventable but only to an extent. It begins as gingivitis which can be reversed by appropriate oral hygiene methods however, once bone resoprtion begings it cannot be reversed without the active intervention of a qualified dental professional.

        <h4>Myths and facts</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Myth - Periodontitis is an inevitable result of aging</li>
            <li>Fact - Advanced age can increase the accumulation of the risk factors for periodontitis however, it is NOT an inevitable result of aging as it can be completely prevented by proper oral hygiene measures and treatment of systemic diseases like diabetes and cessation of cigarette smoking. </li>
            <li>Myth - Only old people can be affected by periodontitis</li>
            <li>Fact - Periodontitis is a broad term for any inflammation of the periodontium associated with bone resorption. It can affect any age group in different forms and rates of progression.</li>
            <li>Bleeding gums while brushing is normal</li>
            <li>Gum bleeding is one of the earliest signs of gingivitis which is one of the prequels for full blown periodontitis. However, if the inflammation is reserved to the periodontium, it can be reversed by self and professional oral hygiene measures.</li>
